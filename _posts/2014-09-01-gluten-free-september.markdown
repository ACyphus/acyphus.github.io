For the month of September 2014, the Cyphus household is going gluten-free.

My (new) wife was talking about the potential health benefits of a gluten-free diet. This was a few months ago. The health benefits are mainly for my wife, but to support her and make cooking and meal planning easier I decided to try it to.

September seemed a sensible month to pick. After the mayhem of getting married in August, a September detox is a sensible idea.

So here we are. 1st September. Soon to be 1 day gluten-free.

Throughout the month I'm going to be posting about my experiences.

With technology, resiliency is critical. If one part of a system goes down or begins to fail, the rest of the system should be resilient enough to continue functioning.

I like to apply these principals to real life situations:

- Could I navigate somewhere without GPS or turn-by-turn navigation?
- Could I complete the essential daily tasks without my car?
- Could I write a blog post on paper if my computer wasn't working?
- Could I comfortably watch a movie without my regular sitting room chair?

That last one inspired this weeks experiment:

This experiment is a combination of testing my mind and body's resilience to my dependancy on a reasonably comfortable chair for viewing my TV, and seeing if I sit in a chair out of habit or necessity.

I usually spend 2-3 hours each evening in this chair. It will be interesting to see how this affects my normal habits.

This experiement concludes on the evening of Sunday 7th September. I will post an update detailing my findings.

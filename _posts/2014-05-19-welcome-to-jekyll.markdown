So this is Jekyll. I'd heard a lot of good things.

I was originally putting together a custom blog/site in PHP using Silex, 
but decided not to re-invent the wheel. The prospect of hosting with GitHub Pages was also very 
convincing.

So this is the first post of the new blog. A new leaf as it were. 
I've decided I don't want to carry any content over from my previous set of thoughts.

So my thoughts on Jekyll. Extremely easy, very clean. Just what I need!
